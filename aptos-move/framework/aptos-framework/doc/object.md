# Module `0x1::object`

This defines the Move object model with the following properties:
&#45; Simplified storage interface that supports a heterogeneous collection of resources to be
stored together. This enables data types to share a common core data layer (e.g., tokens),
while having richer extensions (e.g., concert ticket, sword).
&#45; Globally accessible data and ownership model that enables creators and developers to dictate
the application and lifetime of data.
&#45; Extensible programming model that supports individualization of user applications that
leverage the core framework including tokens.
&#45; Support emitting events directly, thus improving discoverability of events associated with
objects.
&#45; Considerate of the underlying system by leveraging resource groups for gas efficiency,
avoiding costly deserialization and serialization costs, and supporting deletability.

TODO:
&#42; There is no means to borrow an object or a reference to an object. We are exploring how to
make it so that a reference to a global object can be returned from a function.

```move
module 0x1::object {
    const EOBJECT_DOES_NOT_EXIST: u64 = 2;
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_EOBJECT_EXISTS"></a>

An object already exists at this address


```move
module 0x1::object {
    const EOBJECT_EXISTS: u64 = 1;
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_EOBJECT_NOT_BURNT"></a>

Cannot reclaim objects that weren&apos;t burnt.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    const EOBJECT_NOT_BURNT: u64 = 8;
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_EOBJECT_NOT_TRANSFERRABLE"></a>

Object is untransferable any operations that might result in a transfer are disallowed.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    const EOBJECT_NOT_TRANSFERRABLE: u64 = 9;
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_ERESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST"></a>

}
```


<a id="0x1_object_MAXIMUM_OBJECT_NESTING"></a>

Maximum nesting from one object to another. That is objects can technically have infinte
nesting, but any checks such as transfer will only be evaluated this deep.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    const MAXIMUM_OBJECT_NESTING: u8 = 8;
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_OBJECT_DERIVED_SCHEME"></a>

Scheme identifier used to generate an object&apos;s address `obj_addr` as derived from another object.
The object&apos;s address is generated as:
```
obj_addr &#61; sha3_256(account addr &#124; derived from object&apos;s address &#124; 0xFC)
```

This 0xFC constant serves as a domain separation tag to prevent existing authentication key and resource account
derivation to produce an object address.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    const OBJECT_DERIVED_SCHEME: u8 = 252;
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_OBJECT_FROM_GUID_ADDRESS_SCHEME"></a>

Scheme identifier used to generate an object&apos;s address `obj_addr` via a fresh GUID generated by the creator at
`source_addr`. The object&apos;s address is generated as:
```
obj_addr &#61; sha3_256(guid &#124; 0xFD)
```
where `guid = account::create_guid(create_signer(source_addr))`

This 0xFD constant serves as a domain separation tag to prevent existing authentication key and resource account
derivation to produce an object address.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    const OBJECT_FROM_GUID_ADDRESS_SCHEME: u8 = 253;
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_OBJECT_FROM_SEED_ADDRESS_SCHEME"></a>

obj_addr &#61; sha3_256(source_addr &#124; seed &#124; 0xFE).

This 0xFE constant serves as a domain separation tag to prevent existing authentication key and resource account
derivation to produce an object address.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    const OBJECT_FROM_SEED_ADDRESS_SCHEME: u8 = 254;
}
```

}
```


<a id="0x1_object_create_object_from_account"></a>

## Function `create_object_from_account`

Use `create_object` instead.
Create a new object from a GUID generated by an account.
As the GUID creation internally increments a counter, two transactions that executes

Therefore, using `create_object` method for creating objects is preferrable as it
doesn&apos;t have the same bottlenecks.

Therefore, using `create_object` method for creating objects is preferrable as it
doesn&apos;t have the same bottlenecks.


```move
module 0x1::object {

<a id="0x1_object_generate_linear_transfer_ref"></a>

## Function `generate_linear_transfer_ref`

Create a LinearTransferRef for a one&#45;time transfer. This requires that the owner at the
time of generation is the owner at the time of transferring.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public fun generate_linear_transfer_ref(ref: &object::TransferRef): object::LinearTransferRef
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_transfer_with_ref"></a>

## Function `transfer_with_ref`

Transfer to the destination address using a LinearTransferRef.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public fun transfer_with_ref(ref: object::LinearTransferRef, to: address)
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_transfer_call"></a>

## Function `transfer_call`

Entry function that can be used to transfer, if allow_ungated_transfer is set true.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public entry fun transfer_call(owner: &signer, object: address, to: address)
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_transfer"></a>

## Function `transfer`

Transfers ownership of the object (and all associated resources) at the specified address
for Object&lt;T&gt; to the &quot;to&quot; address.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public entry fun transfer<T: key>(owner: &signer, object: object::Object<T>, to: address)
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_transfer_raw"></a>

## Function `transfer_raw`

Attempts to transfer using addresses only. Transfers the given object if
allow_ungated_transfer is set true. Note, that this allows the owner of a nested object to
transfer that object, so long as allow_ungated_transfer is enabled at each stage in the
hierarchy.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public fun transfer_raw(owner: &signer, object: address, to: address)
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_transfer_to_object"></a>

## Function `transfer_to_object`

Transfer the given object to another object. See `transfer` for more information.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public entry fun transfer_to_object<O: key, T: key>(owner: &signer, object: object::Object<O>, to: object::Object<T>)
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_burn"></a>

## Function `burn`

Forcefully transfer an unwanted object to BURN_ADDRESS, ignoring whether ungated_transfer is allowed.
This only works for objects directly owned and for simplicity does not apply to indirectly owned objects.
Original owners can reclaim burnt objects any time in the future by calling unburn.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public entry fun burn<T: key>(owner: &signer, object: object::Object<T>)
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_unburn"></a>

## Function `unburn`

Allow origin owners to reclaim any objects they previous burnt.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public entry fun unburn<T: key>(original_owner: &signer, object: object::Object<T>)
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_ungated_transfer_allowed"></a>

## Function `ungated_transfer_allowed`

Accessors
Return true if ungated transfer is allowed.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public fun ungated_transfer_allowed<T: key>(object: object::Object<T>): bool
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_owner"></a>

## Function `owner`

Return the current owner.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public fun owner<T: key>(object: object::Object<T>): address
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_is_owner"></a>

## Function `is_owner`

Return true if the provided address is the current owner.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public fun is_owner<T: key>(object: object::Object<T>, owner: address): bool
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_owns"></a>

## Function `owns`

Return true if the provided address has indirect or direct ownership of the provided object.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public fun owns<T: key>(object: object::Object<T>, owner: address): bool
}
```


<a id="0x1_object_root_owner"></a>

## Function `root_owner`

Returns the root owner of an object. As objects support nested ownership, it can be useful
to determine the identity of the starting point of ownership.


```move
module 0x1::object {
    public fun root_owner<T: key>(object: object::Object<T>): address
}
```
