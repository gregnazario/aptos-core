# Module `0x1::stake`


Validator lifecycle:
1. Prepare a validator node set up and call stake::initialize_validator
2. Once ready to deposit stake (or have funds assigned by a staking service in exchange for ownership capability),
call stake::add_stake (or &#42;_with_cap versions if called from the staking service)
3. Call stake::join_validator_set (or _with_cap version) to join the active validator set. Changes are effective in
the next epoch.
4. Validate and gain rewards. The stake will automatically be locked up for a fixed duration (set by governance) and
automatically renewed at expiration.
5. At any point, if the validator operator wants to update the consensus key or network/fullnode addresses, they can
call stake::rotate_consensus_key and stake::update_network_and_fullnode_addresses. Similar to changes to stake, the
changes to consensus key/network/fullnode addresses are only effective in the next epoch.
6. Validator can request to unlock their stake at any time. However, their stake will only become withdrawable when
their current lockup expires. This can be at most as long as the fixed lockup duration.
7. After exiting, the validator can either explicitly leave the validator set by calling stake::leave_validator_set
or if their stake drops below the min required, they would get removed at the end of the epoch.
8. Validator can always rejoin the validator set by going through steps 2&#45;3 again.
9. An owner can always switch operators by calling stake::set_operator.
10. An owner can always switch designated voter by calling stake::set_designated_voter.

<a id="0x1_stake_OwnerCapability"></a>

## Resource `OwnerCapability`

Capability that represents ownership and can be used to control the validator and the associated stake pool.
Having this be separate from the signer for the account that the validator resources are hosted at allows
modules to have control over a validator.


```move
module 0x1::stake {
    struct OwnerCapability has store, key
}
```


<a id="0x1_stake_StakePool"></a>

## Resource `StakePool`

Each validator has a separate StakePool resource and can provide a stake.
Changes in stake for an active validator:
1. If a validator calls add_stake, the newly added stake is moved to pending_active.
2. If validator calls unlock, their stake is moved to pending_inactive.
2. When the next epoch starts, any pending_inactive stake is moved to inactive and can be withdrawn.
Any pending_active stake is moved to active and adds to the validator&apos;s voting power.

Changes in stake for an inactive validator:
1. If a validator calls add_stake, the newly added stake is moved directly to active.
2. If validator calls unlock, their stake is moved directly to inactive.
3. When the next epoch starts, the validator can be activated if their active stake is more than the minimum.


```move
module 0x1::stake {
    struct StakePool has key
}
```


<a id="0x1_stake_ValidatorConfig"></a>

## Resource `ValidatorConfig`

<a id="0x1_stake_ValidatorSet"></a>

## Resource `ValidatorSet`

Full ValidatorSet, stored in @aptos_framework.

The staking pool&apos;s voting power in this new epoch will be updated to the total active stake.
3. Add pending active validators to the active set if they satisfy requirements so they can vote and remove
pending inactive validators so they no longer can vote.
4. The validator&apos;s voting power in the validator set is updated to be the corresponding staking pool&apos;s voting
power.
