# Module `0x1::staking_contract`

Allow stakers and operators to enter a staking contract with reward sharing.
The main accounting logic in a staking contract consists of 2 parts:
1. Tracks how much commission needs to be paid out to the operator. This is tracked with an increasing principal
amount that&apos;s updated every time the operator requests commission, the staker withdraws funds, or the staker
switches operators.
2. Distributions of funds to operators (commissions) and stakers (stake withdrawals) use the shares model provided
by the pool_u64 to track shares that increase in price as the stake pool accumulates rewards.

Example flow:
1. A staker creates a staking contract with an operator by calling create_staking_contract() with 100 coins of
initial stake and commission &#61; 10%. This means the operator will receive 10% of any accumulated rewards. A new stake
pool will be created and hosted in a separate account that&apos;s controlled by the staking contract.
2. The operator sets up a validator node and, once ready, joins the validator set by calling stake::join_validator_set
3. After some time, the stake pool gains rewards and now has 150 coins.
4. Operator can now call request_commission. 10% of (150 &#45; 100) &#61; 5 coins will be unlocked from the stake pool. The
staker&apos;s principal is now updated from 100 to 145 (150 coins &#45; 5 coins of commission). The pending distribution pool
has 5 coins total and the operator owns all 5 shares of it.
5. Some more time has passed. The pool now has 50 more coins in rewards and a total balance of 195. The operator
calls request_commission again. Since the previous 5 coins have now become withdrawable, it&apos;ll be deposited into the
operator&apos;s account first. Their new commission will be 10% of (195 coins &#45; 145 principal) &#61; 5 coins. Principal is
updated to be 190 (195 &#45; 5). Pending distribution pool has 5 coins and operator owns all 5 shares.
6. Staker calls unlock_stake to unlock 50 coins of stake, which gets added to the pending distribution pool. Based
on shares math, staker will be owning 50 shares and operator still owns 5 shares of the 55&#45;coin pending distribution
pool.
7. Some time passes and the 55 coins become fully withdrawable from the stake pool. Due to accumulated rewards, the
55 coins become 70 coins. Calling distribute() distributes 6 coins to the operator and 64 coins to the validator.

```


<a id="0x1_staking_contract_set_beneficiary_for_operator"></a>

## Function `set_beneficiary_for_operator`

Allows an operator to change its beneficiary. Any existing unpaid commission rewards will be paid to the new
beneficiary. To ensures payment to the current beneficiary, one should first call `distribute` before switching
the beneficiary. An operator can set one beneficiary for staking contract pools, not a separate one for each pool.


```move
module 0x1::staking_contract {
    public entry fun set_beneficiary_for_operator(operator: &signer, new_beneficiary: address)
}
```


<a id="0x1_staking_contract_distribute"></a>

## Function `distribute`

not need to be restricted to just the staker or operator.


```move
module 0x1::staking_contract {
    public entry fun distribute(staker: address, operator: address)
}
```
