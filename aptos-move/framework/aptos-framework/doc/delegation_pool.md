# Module `0x1::delegation_pool`


Allow multiple delegators to participate in the same stake pool in order to collect the minimum
stake required to join the validator set. Delegators are rewarded out of the validator rewards
proportionally to their stake and provided the same stake&#45;management API as the stake pool owner.

The main accounting logic in the delegation pool contract handles the following:
1. Tracks how much stake each delegator owns, privately deposited as well as earned.
Accounting individual delegator stakes is achieved through the shares&#45;based pool defined at
<code>aptos_std::pool_u64</code>, hence delegators own shares rather than absolute stakes into the delegation pool.
2. Tracks rewards earned by the stake pool, implicitly by the delegation one, in the meantime
and distribute them accordingly.
3. Tracks lockup cycles on the stake pool in order to separate inactive stake (not earning rewards)
from pending_inactive stake (earning rewards) and allow its delegators to withdraw the former.
4. Tracks how much commission fee has to be paid to the operator out of incoming rewards before
distributing them to the internal pool_u64 pools.

In order to distinguish between stakes in different states and route rewards accordingly,
separate pool_u64 pools are used for individual stake states:
1. one of <code>active</code> &#43; <code>pending_active</code> stake
2. one of <code>inactive</code> stake FOR each past observed lockup cycle (OLC) on the stake pool
3. one of <code>pending_inactive</code> stake scheduled during this ongoing OLC

As stake&#45;state transitions and rewards are computed only at the stake pool level, the delegation pool
gets outdated. To mitigate this, at any interaction with the delegation pool, a process of synchronization
to the underlying stake pool is executed before the requested operation itself.

At synchronization:
&#45; stake deviations between the two pools are actually the rewards produced in the meantime.
&#45; the commission fee is extracted from the rewards, the remaining stake is distributed to the internal
pool_u64 pools and then the commission stake used to buy shares for operator.
&#45; if detecting that the lockup expired on the stake pool, the delegation pool will isolate its
pending_inactive stake (now inactive) and create a new pool_u64 to host future pending_inactive stake
scheduled this newly started lockup.
Detecting a lockup expiration on the stake pool resumes to detecting new inactive stake.

Accounting main invariants:
&#45; each stake&#45;management operation (add/unlock/reactivate/withdraw) and operator change triggers
the synchronization process before executing its own function.
&#45; each OLC maps to one or more real lockups on the stake pool, but not the opposite. Actually, only a real
lockup with &apos;activity&apos; (which inactivated some unlocking stake) triggers the creation of a new OLC.
&#45; unlocking and/or unlocked stake originating from different real lockups are never mixed together into
the same pool_u64. This invalidates the accounting of which rewards belong to whom.
&#45; no delegator can have unlocking and/or unlocked stake (pending withdrawals) in different OLCs. This ensures
delegators do not have to keep track of the OLCs when they unlocked. When creating a new pending withdrawal,
the existing one is executed (withdrawn) if is already inactive.
&#45; <code>add_stake</code> fees are always refunded, but only after the epoch when they have been charged ends.
&#45; withdrawing pending_inactive stake (when validator had gone inactive before its lockup expired)
does not inactivate any stake additional to the requested one to ensure OLC would not advance indefinitely.
&#45; the pending withdrawal exists at an OLC iff delegator owns some shares within the shares pool of that OLC.

Example flow:
<ol>
<li>A node operator creates a delegation pool by calling
<code>initialize_delegation_pool</code> and sets
its commission fee to 0% (for simplicity). A stake pool is created with no initial stake and owned by
a resource account controlled by the delegation pool.</li>
<li>Delegator A adds 100 stake which is converted to 100 shares into the active pool_u64</li>
<li>Operator joins the validator set as the stake pool has now the minimum stake</li>
<li>The stake pool earned rewards and now has 200 active stake. A&apos;s active shares are worth 200 coins as
the commission fee is 0%.</li>
<li></li>
<ol>
<li>A requests <code>unlock</code> for 100 stake</li>
<li>Synchronization detects 200 &#45; 100 active rewards which are entirely (0% commission) added to the active pool.</li>
<li>100 coins &#61; (100 &#42; 100) / 200 &#61; 50 shares are redeemed from the active pool and exchanged for 100 shares
into the pending_inactive one on A&apos;s behalf</li>
</ol>
<li>Delegator B adds 200 stake which is converted to (200 &#42; 50) / 100 &#61; 100 shares into the active pool</li>
<li>The stake pool earned rewards and now has 600 active and 200 pending_inactive stake.</li>
<li></li>
<ol>
<li>A requests <code>reactivate_stake</code> for 100 stake</li>
<li>
Synchronization detects 600 &#45; 300 active and 200 &#45; 100 pending_inactive rewards which are both entirely
distributed to their corresponding pools
</li>
<li>
100 coins &#61; (100 &#42; 100) / 200 &#61; 50 shares are redeemed from the pending_inactive pool and exchanged for
(100 &#42; 150) / 600 &#61; 25 shares into the active one on A&apos;s behalf
</li>
</ol>
<li>The lockup expires on the stake pool, inactivating the entire pending_inactive stake</li>
<li></li>
<ol>
<li>B requests <code>unlock</code> for 100 stake</li>
<li>
Synchronization detects no active or pending_inactive rewards, but 0 &#45;&gt; 100 inactive stake on the stake pool,
so it advances the observed lockup cycle and creates a pool_u64 for the new lockup, hence allowing previous
pending_inactive shares to be redeemed</li>
<li>
100 coins &#61; (100 &#42; 175) / 700 &#61; 25 shares are redeemed from the active pool and exchanged for 100 shares
into the new pending_inactive one on B&apos;s behalf
</li>
</ol>
<li>The stake pool earned rewards and now has some pending_inactive rewards.</li>
<li></li>
<ol>
<li>A requests <code>withdraw</code> for its entire inactive stake</li>
<li>
Synchronization detects no new inactive stake, but some pending_inactive rewards which are distributed
to the (2nd) pending_inactive pool
</li>
<li>
A&apos;s 50 shares &#61; (50 &#42; 100) / 50 &#61; 100 coins are redeemed from the (1st) inactive pool and 100 stake is
transferred to A
</li>
</ol>

There is not enough `active` stake on the stake pool to `unlock`.


```move
module 0x1::delegation_pool {
    const ENOT_ENOUGH_ACTIVE_STAKE_TO_UNLOCK: u64 = 6;
}
```


<a id="0x1_delegation_pool_EOPERATOR_BENEFICIARY_CHANGE_NOT_SUPPORTED"></a>

<a id="0x1_delegation_pool_ESLASHED_INACTIVE_STAKE_ON_PAST_OLC"></a>

Slashing (if implemented) should not be applied to already `inactive` stake.
Not only it invalidates the accounting of past observed lockup cycles (OLC),
but is also unfair to delegators whose stake has been inactive before validator started misbehaving.
Additionally, the inactive stake does not count on the voting power of validator.

<a id="0x1_delegation_pool_MIN_COINS_ON_SHARES_POOL"></a>

Minimum coins to exist on a shares pool at all times.
Enforced per delegator for both active and pending_inactive pools.
This constraint ensures the share price cannot overly increase and lead to
substantial losses when buying shares (can lose at most 1 share which may
be worth a lot if current share price is high).
This constraint is not enforced on inactive pools as they only allow redeems
(can lose at most 1 coin regardless of current share price).


```move
module 0x1::delegation_pool {
    const MIN_COINS_ON_SHARES_POOL: u64 = 1000000000;

<a id="0x1_delegation_pool_get_add_stake_fee"></a>

## Function `get_add_stake_fee`

Return refundable stake to be extracted from added `amount` at `add_stake` operation on pool `pool_address`.
If the validator produces rewards this epoch, added stake goes directly to `pending_active` and
does not earn rewards. However, all shares within a pool appreciate uniformly and when this epoch ends:
&#45; either added shares are still `pending_active` and steal from rewards of existing `active` stake
&#45; or have moved to `pending_inactive` and get full rewards (they displaced `active` stake at `unlock`)
To mitigate this, some of the added stake is extracted and fed back into the pool as placeholder
for the rewards the remaining stake would have earned if active:
extracted&#45;fee &#61; (amount &#45; extracted&#45;fee) &#42; reward&#45;rate% &#42; (100% &#45; operator&#45;commission%)


```move
