# Module `0x1::aptos_governance`


AptosGovernance represents the on&#45;chain governance of the Aptos network. Voting power is calculated based on the
current epoch&apos;s voting power of the proposer or voter&apos;s backing stake pool. In addition, for it to count,
the stake pool&apos;s lockup needs to be at least as long as the proposal&apos;s duration.

It provides the following flow:
1. Proposers can create a proposal by calling AptosGovernance::create_proposal. The proposer&apos;s backing stake pool
needs to have the minimum proposer stake required. Off&#45;chain components can subscribe to CreateProposalEvent to
track proposal creation and proposal ids.
2. Voters can vote on a proposal. Their voting power is derived from the backing stake pool. A stake pool can vote
on a proposal multiple times as long as the total voting power of these votes doesn&apos;t exceed its total voting power.

<a id="0x1_aptos_governance_reconfigure"></a>

## Function `reconfigure`

Manually reconfigure. Called at the end of a governance txn that alters on&#45;chain configs.

WARNING: this function always ensures a reconfiguration starts, but when the reconfiguration finishes depends.
&#45; If feature `RECONFIGURE_WITH_DKG` is disabled, it finishes immediately.
&#45; At the end of the calling transaction, we will be in a new epoch.
&#45; If feature `RECONFIGURE_WITH_DKG` is enabled, it starts DKG, and the new epoch will start in a block prologue after DKG finishes.

This behavior affects when an update of an on&#45;chain config (e.g. `ConsensusConfig`, `Features`) takes effect,
since such updates are applied whenever we enter an new epoch.


```move
module 0x1::aptos_governance {
    public entry fun reconfigure(aptos_framework: &signer)
}
```


<a id="0x1_aptos_governance_force_end_epoch"></a>

## Function `force_end_epoch`

Change epoch immediately.
If `RECONFIGURE_WITH_DKG` is enabled and we are in the middle of a DKG,
stop waiting for DKG and enter the new epoch without randomness.

WARNING: currently only used by tests. In most cases you should use `reconfigure()` instead.
TODO: migrate these tests to be aware of async reconfiguration.


```move
module 0x1::aptos_governance {
    public entry fun force_end_epoch(aptos_framework: &signer)
}
```


<a id="0x1_aptos_governance_force_end_epoch_test_only"></a>

}
```


<a id="0x1_aptos_governance_toggle_features"></a>
